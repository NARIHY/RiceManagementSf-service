## Introduction

Our API is built around a set of services that encapsulate the logic required to perform actions within the controllers. These services facilitate the communication between the API endpoints and the underlying business logic, ensuring a clean and maintainable architecture.

## Service Responsibilities

The services in this API are responsible for:
- Handling all actions related to data manipulation (create, read, update, delete).
- Implementing business logic and validation rules.
- Interacting with the database or other external services.
- Managing errors and responses to ensure consistent output.

## Available Services

  - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
  - `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve user details.
  - `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user information.
  - `DELETE /users/{id}`: Remove a user.

- **Description:** This service manages user-related actions, including registration, updates, and deletions. It handles all validation and business logic to ensure proper user management.

### Product Management Service

- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of products.
  - `GET /products/{id}`: Retrieve product details.
  - `POST /products`: Add a new product.
  - `PUT /products/{id}`: Update product information.
  - `DELETE /products/{id}`: Remove a product.

- **Description:** This service oversees product-related actions, ensuring that products can be created, updated, and deleted in a consistent manner.

### Order Management Service

- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /orders`: Retrieve a list of orders.
  - `GET /orders/{id}`: Retrieve order details.
  - `POST /orders`: Create a new order.
  - `PUT /orders/{id}`: Update an existing order.
  - `DELETE /orders/{id}`: Cancel an order.

- **Description:** This service manages order processing, encapsulating all logic related to order creation, updates, and cancellations.

### Payment Processing Service

- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /payments`: Process a new payment.
  - `GET /payments/{id}`: Retrieve payment details.
  - `GET /payments`: Retrieve a list of payments.

- **Description:** This service is responsible for handling payment transactions, ensuring that payments are processed securely and accurately.

## Error Handling

Each service implements comprehensive error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and messages. Common responses include:
- `200 OK`: Successful request.
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication error.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected error occurred.

## Authentication

All actions require authentication. Include a valid token in the `Authorization` header for every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## Usage Examples

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create a new user using the User Management Service:

### Creating a New User

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <your-token>'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'newuser',
    email: 'user@example.com',
    password: 'securepassword'
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
